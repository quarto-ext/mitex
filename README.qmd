# Use mitex for Typst Math with Quarto

::: {.callout-warning}

Experimental extension

:::

This is a Quarto extension that provides support for using the [Mitex](https://typst.app/universe/package/mitex/) Typst library to render mathematical expressions.

## Installing

```bash
quarto add quarto-ext/mitex
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Using

To use the extension, add the following to your Quarto document:

```yaml
filters: 
  - mitex
```

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal example: [example.qmd](example.qmd).

- Inline Math will be wrapped in a Typst RawInline using `#mi()`
- Display Math will be transformat to Typst RawBlock using `#mitex()`
